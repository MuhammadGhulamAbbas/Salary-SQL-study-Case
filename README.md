# Salary Study Case SQL Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing salary data to derive insights into global compensation trends across various job roles and locations. Using SQL queries, the project aims to identify countries offering high-paying remote roles, analyze company size distributions, calculate percentages of high-paying remote positions, compare average salaries by job title and location, determine top-paying countries per job title, and track salary growth trends over the past few years.

## Experience Highlights

- Implemented complex SQL queries to extract and analyze salary data.
- Utilized SQL functions and CTEs for data aggregation and analysis.
- Conducted comprehensive statistical analysis and trend tracking using SQL.
- Developed queries to identify top-paying countries, remote work trends, and entry-level salary differentials.
- Created SQL scripts for visualizing salary data and trends.
